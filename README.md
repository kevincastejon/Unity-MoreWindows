# Unity-TimeScaleWindow

Exposes the **TimeScale** setting into **simple windows**.

Provides an **Editor window** that you can tab wherever you want, and a draggable **UI prefab** that you can drop into a **canvas** for built runtime purpose.

Forget about the **Project Settings** window and its **Time** panel, change the speed of your game in no time.

## Technical details

Provides a **Slider** clamped between **0** and **10**, along with several preset buttons.

It also have a **responsive design** that will adapt itself to the size of the **window**, **tab** or **canvas element** size.

Also provides a **RuntimeTimeScaler** component that owns a **SetTimeScale(float ***value***)** public method, bindable to **UnityEvents**, that helps implementing your custom interface for controlling the **TimeScale**, if you need to.
